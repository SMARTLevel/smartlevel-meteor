          <p>Jesse was born into a remote Nigerian tribe of stranded Hebrew missionaries. Until his relocation to the US in 2004, he had never eaten conventional 
food, and lived solely off of edible wild grasses and his own hair. He was inspired to start programming after watching the 1999 Disney classic "Smart House"
and is now well versed in HTML5 and C++ coding. </p>

          <img src="/img/Danielle.jpg">
          <p>As a young lady, Danielle was a very promising opera singer. Unfortunately, her hopes of stardom were dashed in 1999 when she mistook a bottle of 
ether for mineral water, and effectively ended her singing career. She soon took and interest in computer programming, a field in which vocal socialization 
can be minimal. She plays a vital role for our team, and makes sure to clearly label all liquids in and around the office.

          <p>Born the heiress to the "fruit-on-the-bottom" yogurt fortune, Michelle enjoyed a privileged childhood. Despite a successful international fencing
career, her true passion lies in the field of computer programming. Her web design pedigree is distinguished and constantly expanding. She currently lives
at her summer home in the Berkshires, where she breeds prize-winning Corgis and maintains the world's second-largest collection of Edwardian utility bills.

          <img src="/img/Tyler.jpg">
          <p> After winning a high-dollar malpractice suit against his eye doctor in 2005, Tyler dropped out of Jr High school to pursue a life of doing nothing.
He made national news in 2007 when he filled a swimming pool with pudding, attempted to swim in it, and very nearly drowned. Since then, he has taken an 
interest in watching other people write code, and has had a successful career in doing so. </p>

          <img src="/img/Matt.jpg">
          <p>Until the summer of 1996, Matt did not technically exist. Due to a hospital error shortly after his birth, he was never given a Social Security number 
or an official name until the problem was edified due to an IRS audit. After high school, he worked from 2001-2005 as the touring keyboardist for the Allman 
Brothers, after which he gave up his music career to pursue computer science. He has forged a successful software development career, and will still play you 
a song every once in a while if you ask him nicely.</p>

          <p>Nathan is the current world record holder for the most chocolate covered cherries eaten in a single minute, at 44. Riding the wave of this fame and an 
incredible natural talent for programming, he was able to make ground-level contacts at industry giants such as Travelocity.com and Paypal, amongst countless 
others. Along with occasional freelance coding work, Nathan is pursuing his second world record: the most blindfolded full court basketball shots made in a 
single minute. The record currently lies a 0.</p>
